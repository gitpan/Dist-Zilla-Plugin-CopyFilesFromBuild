NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyFilesFromBuild - Copy (or move) specific files
    after building (for SCM inclusion, etc.)

VERSION
    version 0.103450

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [CopyFilesFromBuild]
        copy = README
        move = README.pod
        copy = Makefile.PL

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will automatically copy the files that you specify in
    dist.ini from the build directory into the distribution directoory. This
    is so you can commit them to version control.

    If you want to put a build-generated file in version control but you
    *don't* want it to *remain* in the build dir, use "move" instead of
    "copy". When you use "move", the MANIFEST file will be updated if it
    exists, and the moved files will be pruned from their former location.

RATIONALE
    This plugin is based on CopyReadmeFromBuild. I wrote it because that
    plugin was copying the wrong README file (README instead of README.mkdn
    or README.pod), and it could not be configured to do otherwise. So I
    wrote my own module that copies exactly the files that I specify.

    I added the "move" functionality because I wanted to generate a
    README.pod file for Github, but MakeMaker wanted to also install the
    README.pod file as part of the distribution. So I made it possible to
    take a file generated during the build and move it *out* of the build
    directory, so that it would not be included in the distribution.
